Why skin preparation is important?
***********************************

Proper skin preparation is crucial before recording any biopotential signal be it Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electroencephalography (EEG), or Electrooculography (EOG).

- ``Reduction of artifacts`` Removes dead skin cells, oils, & other substances that may introduce noise or artifacts into the recorded signals.
- ``Electrode-skin contact`` Ensures optimal contact between the electrodes and the skin surface. Improves the conduction of electrical signals from the body to the recording equipment and minimizes impedance.
- ``Signal quality`` Enhances the overall quality of recorded signals, providing clear & reliable data for analysis & improves the ability to capture subtle variations in biopotential signals.
- ``Consistency in recordings`` Reduces variability in signal quality, making it easier to make any Human-Computer Interface(HCI), Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) project or a real-world application.
- ``Long term adhesion`` Facilitates long-term adhesion & stable placement of electrodes to the skin during extended signal monitoring.

Requirements
**************

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **NuPrep Gel**                      | Mildly abrasive, highly conductive gel that should be applied before placing the electrodes on the skin to improve signal quality & enhances the performance of monitoring electrodes.                |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Electrode Gel**                   | Highly conductive gel that acts as a coupling agent between electrodes and the skin to aid the transmission of biopotential signals like ECG, EMG, EOG, or EEG.                                       |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Ten20 Paste**                     | Contains the right balance of adhesiveness and conductivity, enabling the dry electrodes to remain in place while allowing the transmittance of biopotential signals.                                 |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Alcohol Swabs/Wet wipes**         | Soft & non-woven pads that helps in cleaning the skin surface and does not leave any residue.                                                                                                         |

Steps to follow
*****************

You can follow the steps given below to do the skin preparation properly:

Step 1: Identify the targeted area
=====================================

Identify the target area where the gel electrodes will be placed for recording ECG, EMG, EEG, or EOG.

Step 2: Apply the gel
======================

Apply a drop of NuPrep gel to your targeted area where the electrodes will be placed.

Step 3
=======

Use gentle, circular motions to rub the gel on the skin surface. This removes all the dead skin cells & improves conductivity.

.. warning:: Do not rub the gel for too long as it has abrasive properties and may cause skin redness and irritation.

Step 4
========

Wipe away excess gel with the alcohol swabs or wet wipes.

.. warning:: Close your eyes while using the alcohol swabs for EOG recording else it may cause eye redness & irritation.

Step 5
========

Now you can either use gel electrodes or the BioAmp bands for the signal recording.

Using gel electrodes
----------------------

  Connect the BioAmp cable to gel electrodes, peel the plastic backing from electrodes and place the IN+, IN-, REF cables according to your specific biopotential recording.

Using BioAmp bands
----------------------

  Connect the BioAmp cable to your BioAmp band. Now apply a small amount of electrode gel or Ten20 conductive paste on the dry electrodes between the skin and metallic part of BioAmp cable. This improves the signal conductivity, enhancing overall signal quality.

Now you are all set! Make all the connections correctly and start recording your biopotential signals.

.. note:: NuPrep gel, Ten20 paste and the alcohol swabs shouldn't be used if you have a history of skin allergies to lotions and cosmetics.
